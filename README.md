This repository contains:
- A Unity 3D project (the original template: https://learn.unity.com/project/fps-template).
- A UML diagram that analyze the implemented scripts relations.
- A technical design document that showcase the research, process and iterations of implementing a new game feature based on the FPS Microgame code base.

To improve my understanding of Unity Engine and C#, I worked on this 8-week programming project that helped me try to mimic the working experience as a programmer in a game company.

I went through the process of adding new mechanics to the FPS Microgame project by analyzing and learning the the original industry-standard level code, as well as creating a technical design document which should be a part of the game design document to help other programmers or designers in the team play around, test and expand the implemented feature --- A rogulike leveling system.

A part of the feature:
